        <p>(b. London) works at the intersection of art, technology, critical pedagogy and poetry. Their films, workshops, poems, ceramics and creative coding experiments often address everyday experiences of the Internet interface, notions of the network and the viral as these intersect and inform social relationships, sexuality, the familial and the commons.
