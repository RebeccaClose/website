Their research addresses the aesthetic dimensions of science, technology and medicine, with a focus on reproduction, and has been supported through residencies with (counter)institutions, including the Center for Art, Design + Social Research (2017-2019) and Hangar.org (2018). Their doctoral research project on <a href = "https://shop.aalto.fi/p/2006-post-internet-queer-reproductive-work-and-the-fixed-capital-of-fertility/">The Fixed Capital of Fertility</a> was awarded the 2024 <a href = "https://www.aalto.fi/en/news/the-annual-review-took-stock-of-the-past-year">Doctoral Thesis Award</a> by the School of Arts, Design and Architecture, Aalto University. They were a Visiting Scholar at ReproSoc, Cambridge University, in 2022.

Their short film <a href ='https://the-wife-of-them-all.glitch.me'><em>The Wife of Them All</em></a> combines documentary, science fiction and collaborations with (non)actors and activists to assemble personal and collective experiences of maintaining queer networks and families in the context of booming fertility markets and intensified border regimes in Europe. The film premiered at the 27th LesGaiCineMad Festival and travelled to the 69th International Oberhausen Short Film Festival with support from HAMACA moving image platform.
