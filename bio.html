        <p>works at the intersection of art, science and technology studies, critical pedagogy and poetry. Their films, ceramic pieces, creative coding experiments and poems often address everyday experiences of the Internet interface, notions of the network and the viral as these intersect and inform sexuality, social relationships, experiences of the familial and access to the commons.

The film premiered at the 27th LesGaiCineMad Festival and travelled to the 69th International Oberhausen Short Film Festival with support from HAMACA moving image platform.
