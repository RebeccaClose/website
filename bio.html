        <p>Rebecca Close (b. London, UK) works at the intersection of science and technology studies and art. Their films, ceramic pieces, creative coding experiments and poems often address everyday experiences of the Internet interface, notions of the network and the viral as these sculpt sexuality, social relationships, experiences of the familial and the commons.
