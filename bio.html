        <p>works at the intersection of art, technology, critical pedagogy and poetry. Their films, workshops, ceramic installations, creative coding experiments and poems often address everyday experiences of the Internet interface, notions of the network and the viral as these intersect and inform social relationships, sexuality, the familial and the commons. 
<br><br>
They are the author of two poetry collections: <a href ='https://blackspringpressgroup.com/products/valid-virtual-vegetable-reality-by-rebecca-close'>Valid, Virtual, Vegetable Reality</a> (Melita Hume Prize, 2017) and <a href = 'https://canal.bigcartel.com/product/replica-by-rebecca-close'> Réplica </a>(Canal, 2022) and edit <a href = "https://www.them-all-magazine.com/projects.html">Them, All Magazine </a>for poetry and Net/Software/Code art. 
<br><br>
Their research work focuses on reproduction and reproductive technologies, and has been supported through residencies and fellowships with (counter)institutions, including the Center for Art, Design + Social Research (2017-2019), Hangar.org (2018), Kone Foundation (2019-2023) and ReproSoc at Cambridge University, where they were a Visiting Scholar in 2022. Their short film <a href ='https://the-wife-of-them-all.glitch.me'><em>The Wife of Them All</em></a> combines documentary and science fiction with collaborations with (non)actors and activists in an assembly of personal and collective experiences of maintaining queer families in the context of commercial assisted reproduction and intensified border regimes in Europe. The film premiered at the 27th LesGaiCineMad Festival and travelled to the 69th International Oberhausen Short Film Festival with support from HAMACA moving image platform.
<br><br>
They studied on the Independent Studies Program at MACBA, Barcelona, (2012) and have since formed part of different collectives, including diásporas críticas and Criticaldías, whose <a href = 'https://criticaldias.net/curatorial'>curatorial projects </a> and <a href = 'https://criticaldias.net/collective-performance'> collective performances </a> center feminist and anticolonial experimental archiving and voice practices. They were a Lecturer in Critical Theory and Experimental Practices at The University of the Arts Guayaquil, Ecuador (2015-2016), and have given classes and workshops on poetic and artistic ways of knowing for adults and young people at many universities and independent arts and activist spaces.
