    'Patrimony of gestures' is a term deriving from the field of archeobotany. It means the study of past bodily reproductive practices via the reading of plant evidence found at archaeological sites, preserved over centuries through waterlogging, carbonisation or imprinting in ceramics. From these 'inscriptions', archeobotanists reconstruct the gestures of past peoples as they worked with and lived on the land. <br><br> But what patrimony of gestures will current reproductive practices leave imprinted? And what occurs when the memory of reproductive practices is not protected, or actively erased?

    Patrimony of Gestures (2018-2022) was a series of exercises in writing, ceramics, performance-reading and listening that consider the idea of ‘reproductive work’ beyond its theorisation as domestic labour, foregrounding myriad forms of communication and political practice, including poetry and art. The project began during an artistic research residency at Casa Velazquez in Madrid in 2018, during which time I collaborated with an archeobotanist.

<em>The Logic of Assistance</em> was the first action, developed as an installation of four audio recordings.  In the audio work I recount the details relating to the institutional, legislative and commercial forces that in the 1990s and early 2000s gave rise to the fertility clinic of today. I was interested in researching assisted reproductive technologies (ARTs) at Casa Velazquez, because it is a French cultural institution located in Spain: an opportunity to think about the different politics of access to ARTs, and more broadly family, in Europe. While in Spain LGBTQIA+ access to ARTs is funded on the public health system, in France at the time of the exhibition in 2019, it was banned. In the audio though I mention neither ‘fertility’ nor ‘biological reproduction’, speaking only of ‘the assisted reproduction of the voice’. The quality, rhythm, volume and tone of my voice shifts as I address four different audiences: the public, a class of students, a parent and a lover.

        <br><br>
          Below the audio were scaled down screen grabs from television and films in which LGBTQIA++ characters engage with ARTs and fertility clinics. These audiovisual narratives of 'queer reproduction' tended to unfold predominantly through the gesture of waiting: characters repeatedly pictured waiting in clinic waiting rooms, waiting in kitchens, waiting at parties, waiting in living rooms etc. I thought of Faith Wilding’s 1974 poem and performance Waiting, in which the speaker’s life is re-cast as a litany of waiting scenes.

      <br><br>
        During the 2018 residency I created a lot of images and videos copying these waiting gestures, a way to consider the question: is waiting, which Wilding analysed in 1974 as a form of feminised labour, now, under biocapital,<em> queer work too? </em>
        <br><br>
        These are just fictional narratives, though, films showing fictional characters played by actors. They are just representations. Yet following Science and Technology Studies (STS) insights into the role of acts of the imagination in patterning value production in the biosciences, 'pop' representations might better be approached as a scientific text: a diagram of the various cycles of laboratory practice and expedition that accumulate to make the clinic infrastructure appear inevitable. Kaushik Sunder Rajan (2006), building on the work of Sarah Franklin and Margaret Lock (2003), suggests the biosciences are unique in the history of capitalist markets because biotech firms are overwhelmingly engaged in promissory hype: marketing activities designed to fashion future investors, buyers and customers for their drugs and services. In the age of personalised medicine, where big-pharma meets genetic testing, the risk-preventation logic reigns and clinics and companies become occupied with fashioning consumers, what Rajan calls biocapital's ‘patients-in-waiting’.

        Might the repeated scene featuring a queer patient-in-waiting reflect the wider privatisation of queer life under capital? By excerpting the ‘waiting queer’ in the context of a French cultural institution, I intended to mobilise an ambivalence around queer use of ARTs and invest the gesture of waiting with a spectral double meaning. On one hand, the waiting queer points to the fabrication of the medicalised subjectivity of the patient-in-waiting under biocapital. On the other, excerpting these images in the French institution protested the pending status of LGBTQIA+ access to ARTs in France.

        Opposite the audio work the <em>Networks of Care=Critique</em> ceramic piece was displayed. The (ongoing) ceramics project began with this archeobotanic idea of 'patrimony of gestures': an inscription of a bodily reproductive practice on the surface of ceramics, kept by weather and time. I sat with a friend to discuss the forms of care –intellectual, emotional or physical– that have been important over our lifespans. We then arrange the information on a genealogical-style diagram divided into decades or years and I made a ceramic plate of the diagram, which belonged to that person. I inscribed the clay using a needle and seeds from the <a href="https://www.redsemillas.info"><em>Red de Semillas</em></a>, a network of community seed banks active in Spain. The work proposes a link between trans*feminist, queer and agroecological 'reproductive' practices, both forms of resistance to state and neoliberal 'reproductive control'.
        <br><br>   
        In the installation at Casa Velazquéz the works offer a counter-inscription that imagines queer reproduction and queer reproductive work beyond the biocapital figure of the patient-in-waiting.

        The rest of the readings and actions took place 2018-2019 and were documented by a series of poster-publications, each one using a different printing technique (typography, digital, offset and screen printing), produced in collaboration with collectives L'Automatica and Madam_tornado in Barcelona. The six posters were read in a performance-reading (with guests Tamara Al-Mashouk and Alba Juventy) at Hangar Center for Art and Technology, Barcelona, in December, 2019.
