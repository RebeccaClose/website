        <p>Rebecca Close (b. London, UK) researches at the intersection of science and technology studies and art. Their work considers how ancient and contemporary media, such as words, bodily gestures, video networks, maga/zines or the Internet, are taken up by people to alter reproductive possibility and life.
<br><br>
They completed the Independent Studies Program at MACBA, Barcelona, (2012) and have since contributed to queer and anticolonial archive and memory projects and arts, performance, writing and translation collectives, including <a href = 'https://criticaldias.net/collective-performance'>diásporas críticas</a>, <a href = 'https://criticaldias.net'>Criticaldías</a> and <a href = 'https://www.c-anal.com'>Canal</a>. They have lectured in New Media and Experimental Practices, and have given classes and workshops on poetic and artistic ways of knowing for adults and young people at many universities and independent arts and activist spaces.         
<br><br> 
Their short film <a href ='https://the-wife-of-them-all.glitch.me'><em>The Wife of Them All</em></a> combines science fiction animation with collaborations with (non)actors to document un/waged queer reproductive work in the city of Barcelona. The film premiered at the 27th LesGaiCineMad Festival and travelled to the 69th International Oberhausen Short Film Festival with support from HAMACA moving image platform. 
<br><br>
Their doctoral thesis <a href = "https://shop.aalto.fi/p/2006-post-internet-queer-reproductive-work-and-the-fixed-capital-of-fertility/">Post-Internet Queer Reproductive Work and The Fixed Capital of Fertility</a> situated emergent computational and digital landscapes of assisted reproduction in a broader history of reproductive struggle, and asked how have artists responded to networked reproductive governance? They were a Visiting Scholar at ReproSoc, Cambridge University, in 2022. 
<br><br>
They are the author of two poetry collections: <a href ='https://blackspringpressgroup.com/products/valid-virtual-vegetable-reality-by-rebecca-close'><em>Valid, Virtual, Vegetable Reality</em></a> (Melita Hume Prize, 2017) and <a href = 'https://canal.bigcartel.com/product/replica-by-rebecca-close'> <em>Réplica</em> </a>(Canal, 2022) and edit <a href = "https://www.them-all-magazine.com/projects.html">Them, All Magazine </a>for poetry and Net/Software/Code art.
