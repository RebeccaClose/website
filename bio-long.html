<p>Rebecca Close (b. London, UK) researches at the intersection of science and technology studies and art. Their work considers how contemporary media, including <a href = 'https://no-niin.com/issue-19/the-is-of-artistic-research/' > poetry & theory</a>, <a href = 'https://rebeccaclose.net/pdfs/Videos_for_Post_Truth_Times_Revisiting_t.pdf' > video/film networks</a>, <a href = 'https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/09589236.2025.2458114' > zines & periodicals</a>, or <a href = 'https://shop.aalto.fi/media/filer_public/f2/a6/f2a63cc4-9030-4944-8fc7-c06c1e1f7c16/aaltoartsbooks_rebeccaclose.pdf' > the Internet interface</a>, are taken up by people to alter reproductive possibility and life.
<br><br>
They are the author of two poetry collections: <a href ='https://blackspringpressgroup.com/products/valid-virtual-vegetable-reality-by-rebecca-close'><em>Valid, Virtual, Vegetable Reality</em></a> (selected by Anthony V. Capildeo to win the 2017 Melita Hume Prize) and <a href = 'https://canal.bigcartel.com/product/replica-by-rebecca-close'> <em>Réplica</em> </a>(Canal, 2022) and edit <a href = "https://www.them-all-magazine.com/projects.html">Them, All Magazine </a>for poetry and Net/Software/Code art. 
<br><br>
Their PhD research on <a href = "https://shop.aalto.fi/p/2006-post-internet-queer-reproductive-work-and-the-fixed-capital-of-fertility/">Queer Reproductive Work and The Fixed Capital of Fertility</a> situated emergent computational and software landscapes of assisted reproduction in a broader history of reproductive struggle in Europe, and asked: how have artists responded to networked reproductive control? The project was awarded the 2024 doctoral thesis award by the Aalto University School of Arts, Design and Architecture and key findings were published in <a href = 'https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/20502877.2024.2371738'><em>The New Bioethics</em></a> and <a href = 'https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/09589236.2025.2458114'><em>The Journal of Gender Studies</em></a>. They were a Visiting Scholar at Cambridge University's ReproSoc in 2022. 
<br><br>
Their recent film <a href ='https://rebeccaclose.net/the-wife-of-them-all.html'><em>The Wife of Them All</em></a> combines science fiction animation with collaborations with (non)actors to document un/waged reproductive work across the cities of Barcelona, Helsinki and London. The film premiered at the 27th LesGaiCineMad Festival and travelled to the 69th International Oberhausen Short Film Festival with support from HAMACA moving image platform. 
<br><br> 
They completed the Independent Studies Program, Barcelona, in 2012 and have since contributed to many collective performance, archiving and translation projects, including <a href = 'https://criticaldias.net/collective-performance'>diásporas críticas</a>, <a href = 'https://www.c-anal.com'>Canal</a> and <a href = 'https://criticaldias.net'>Criticaldías</a>. They were a lecturer in New Media and Experimental Practices (UArtes, 2015-2017), and have given short courses, classes and workshops on poetic and artistic ways of knowing for adults and young people at many universities and independent arts and activist spaces.
